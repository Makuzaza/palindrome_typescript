# Palindrome checker app

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase that reads the same backwards and forwards e.g. madam, racecar. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome

I have written palindrome app in React. Now, this is refactoring the same app in TypeScript

To start:

    cd palindrome_tsc
    npm install
    npm run dev
